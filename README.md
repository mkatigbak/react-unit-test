# Unit test in React

## Overview
The [Weather and Temperature App](https://github.com/mkatigbak/weather-temperature-app), previously created, has been enhanced with comprehensive unit tests and React performance optimizations.

## Features
* The application displays the current weather and temperature for a specific location.
* The user is able to search for a location and see the corresponding weather information.

## Learning Outcome
* Write a unit test in ```React```.

## Note
* The app is not connected to an API for live date updates, and instead will be using ```locations.json``` file as the data source.
